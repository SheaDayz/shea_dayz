Hello everyone!👋🏾

My name's Preshaun Stephens but I prefer to go by Shea, like the tree and it's easier to remember! 
I currently attend Auburn University at Montgomery for a BS in Computer Science. 

I have had a love for video games for as long as I could remember and am aspiring to, one day, be a part of game development. I also hope to learn many cool things about CS like web and app development, as well as learning different languages.

I would love to join different communities and learn more about CS as a whole!
